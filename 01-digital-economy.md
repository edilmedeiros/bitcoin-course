# Lecture 1: What is Money? Why It Breaks

In this first lecture, our goal is to explore what money is, how it emerged, and how it evolved over time.
We are not aiming for a historically precise narrative, nor for an ultimate philosophical definition.
Rather, we are interested in understanding how money has been abstracted throughout history and how its problems, particularly in its fiat form, set the stage for the emergence of Bitcoin.
Our focus is practical:
by the end of this discussion, we want a clear sense of the problems Bitcoin was designed to address.

## Trading without Money is Hard

Imagine two individuals, Alice and Bob.
Alice is an electronics teacher, offering specialized lessons to those interested in learning about circuits, semiconductors, and signal processing.
Bob, on the other hand, is a farmer who grows carrots.
One day, Alice goes to Bob in a fair and offers an introductory lecture about the problems of money and how Bitcoin addresses them in return for a some carrots. At first glance, the exchange seems promising.
Carrots are nutritious food, and knowledge is a valuable asset.
Bob has been hearing about Bitcoin quite frequently lately and was interesting in understanding the technology to expand his business.
The next day, Bob comes to Alice's lecturing room and is delighted with an enlightening lecture.
He promptly hands Alice a basket of freshly harvested carrots and the economic transaction between them is done.

The economic transaction between Alice and Bob occurred because each party perceived the trade as a way to improve their own situation.
Bob valued gaining a better understanding of Bitcoin and its implications for his business more than he valued the basket of carrots he offered in exchange.
Alice, in turn, preferred obtaining fresh produce over giving a lecture.
As Mises explains in Human Action, "Acting man is eager to substitute a more satisfactory state of affairs for a less satisfactory.
His mind imagines conditions which suit him better, and his action aims at bringing about this desired state.
The incentive that impels a man to act is always some uneasiness."
In this example, both Alice and Bob acted to alleviate a sense of uneasiness, each envisioning a better condition achievable through voluntary exchange.
Their trade is a simple but powerful instance of how human cooperation and progress emerge naturally from individual efforts to improve personal circumstances.
However, for a voluntary exchange to occur, it is not enough for one party to desire the trade;
both parties must perceive an improvement in their situation.
If Bob had no interest in Bitcoin—or worse, if he viewed it as a shady technology or associated it with scams—he would have no incentive to accept Alice's offer.
In fact, given that Bitcoin remains a niche topic and is still misunderstood or mistrusted by many in her community, Alice would likely face great difficulty finding anyone willing to trade essential goods like food, clothing, or shelter for her lecture.

Barter relies on the unlikely alignment of immediate desires between two parties—a situation known as the double coincidence of wants.
Alice must find not just anyone, but someone who both needs electronics lectures and has something she personally desires at that moment.
The odds of matching her specialized knowledge to the immediate wants of others are slim.
The burden of matching these wants falls heavily on individuals, forcing them to spend significant time searching for suitable partners.

For Alice, this is particularly problematic.
Teaching is a service dependent on her time and attention.
Every hour spent seeking a trade partner is an hour not spent providing her lectures.
In a barter system, marketing her expertise competes directly with delivering her expertise.
The inefficiency is so profound that Alice might eventually abandon teaching altogether, turning instead to a more commonly needed activity, such as growing vegetables herself.
Society, in this way, does not benefit from specialization:
individuals are pressured to conform to more universally tradable goods and services rather than developing and offering unique talents.
We would not have the complex information-driven society if not for more powerful economic tool on our belts.

## Money as a Solution to the Double Coincidence of Wants

Bob, being a very attentive entrepreneur, quickly recognizes the difficulties in direct barter.
He is not personally interested in attending Alice's lecture, but he trusts her reputation and sees an opportunity.
Bob proposes an alternative arrangement:
he will give Alice a basket of carrots now, in exchange for a written contract—a promise from Alice stating that she will deliver an introductory Bitcoin lecture to whoever presents back the contract in the future.
This type of document is known as an IOU, short for "I Owe You."

Bob’s plan is clever.
He knows Charlie, the local baker, has been curious about Bitcoin for a while.
Bob hopes to use the IOU as a tradeable good:
offering it to Charlie in exchange for bread, a product Bob needs more urgently.
In doing so, Bob separates the problem of wanting bread from the problem of valuing Alice's lectures.
He doesn’t need to personally want Alice's service—he only needs confidence that someone else will.
The IOU functions as an intermediate good, making trade more flexible by broadening the range of possible transactions.
This clever solution effectively reduces the burden of the double coincidence of wants, allowing more specialization and easier trade.

Alice thinks this is a perfect arrangement for her.
After all, she's getting food right now and is happy to have new students, whoever they might be.
She promptly writes and signs the deed and hands it to Bob.
A week later, Bob meets Charlie, the local baker, and offers him the IOU in exchange for a few loaves of bread.
Charlie hesitates at first.
He does not know Alice personally and wonders whether the lecture will be useful to him or if Alice will even fulfill the promise.
He also worries about the authenticity of the document—after all, he knows Bob but cannot be absolutely certain there was no mistake or deceit.
Yet, after some thought, Charlie decides to accept the trade.
Bob has a good reputation, and Charlie sees value in securing a lecture on Bitcoin, even if there are risks.
They complete the trade:
Bob receives his bread, and Charlie holds the IOU promising a future lecture.

At this point, Bob's side of the transaction is fully settled:
he successfully traded Alice’s IOU for the bread he needed.
From his perspective, the trade chain—carrots for an IOU, then the IOU for bread—is complete and satisfactory.
We say it is fully settled.
Using an intermediate asset is more work, but without it the trade would have been impossible, since Charlie was not willing to accept carrots directly.
Intermediate goods like IOUs enable more flexible and complex trades by bridging gaps between what people currently have or will work to produce and what others want.
The initial provider of the good or service (Alice) and the final recipient (Charlie) do not need to interact simultaneously.
By separating immediate consumption from eventual fulfillment, intermediate goods make trade more flexible and scalable, enabling a broader and more dynamic market.

However, while Bob has concluded his exchange successfully, the situation for Charlie remains open-ended.
He now holds a promise of value, not the value itself.
For Charlie, the exchange is not fully settled.
He traded tangible bread—something that required his labor and resources—for a promise that may or may not be fulfilled.
If Alice honors the IOU, Charlie will have gained value;
if not, he will have incurred a loss.
The intermediate asset, while facilitating trade, carries inherent risks for the holder.
This is not unique to personal IOUs:
even commodity money like gold depends on the expectation that it will be accepted by others in future exchanges.
The same applies to fiat currencies and digital assets like Bitcoin.
The holder of an intermediate asset relies, to some extent, on the continued willingness of others to assign it any value.
Thus, while intermediate goods greatly improve market efficiency and flexibility, they also introduce a persistent underlying risk—the uncertainty of future acceptance.
As we will see, the intermediate asset provides other benefits that make them highly desirable in the real world, despite the risk.

While the introduction of an intermediate good greatly facilitates trade, it does not automatically create money.
For an asset to be considered money, it must become the most marketable intermediate good in the economy—the one asset that individuals universally accept in exchange, confident that they can later trade it for whatever they desire.
As Carl Menger explains in On the Origins of Money, money emerges not by decree but through a gradual process where individuals gravitate toward goods that possess superior qualities of marketability.
We will talk about these qualities next.

## Qualities of a good medium of exchange

To understand why some goods thrive as mediums of exchange while others fail, we must consider how well they perform across three critical dimensions:
space, time, and scale.
A good medium of exchange must facilitate trade across different locations (space), preserve value for future transactions (time), and allow practical exchanges of both small and large amounts (scale).

While IOUs improve barter by introducing an intermediate good, they still rely on the trustworthiness and future actions of specific individuals.
This dependence limits their usefulness, especially across broader communities where personal reputation cannot be easily verified.
A natural solution is to adopt "neutral" goods—objects that are not promises of future action but tangible, transferable items.
Neutral goods reduce the need for trust:
their acceptance does not depend on knowing or trusting the previous holder.
Furthermore, because their value is based on general expectations of future acceptance rather than personal obligation, they become more universally recognizable as mediums of exchange.
Throughout history, societies discovered that natural goods such as shells, stones, cattle, salt, and beads could serve this role.
Over time, precious metals like gold and silver emerged as especially favored intermediaries, particularly in ancient Greece.

The key advantage of a neutral good is that it does not depend on trust in any specific issuer.
It is not a debt, and its value in trade does not rest on someone else's future behavior.
Instead, its usefulness as an economic medium of exchange derives solely from the expectation that others will also accept it in future transactions.
Moreover, its suitability for economic exchanges does not hinge on any alternative practical use—such as being consumed as food or processed in industry.
This fundamental shift—from trusting individuals to trusting the generalized marketability of an object—marked a major milestone in the evolution of money.

Beyond spatial acceptance, a good candidate for money must also perform well over time.
It must allow individuals to accumulate value for future use without significant deterioration or loss.
Imagine someone who wishes to eventually buy a house but can only save small amounts at a time.
If the chosen medium of exchange perishes, rots, or erodes in value over time, saving becomes practically impossible.
Goods like fresh produce or cigarettes, although used as money in extreme circumstances, are poorly suited for long-term value storage.

Durability is crucial, but so is scarcity:
the medium must not be easily reproducible, otherwise saving is undermined by inflation.
To illustrate, consider an economy with 50 stones used as money and 10 spears available for trade.
If each spear costs 5 stones on average, and suddenly someone finds a mine producing 50 additional stones, the average price of spears would fall to 2 stones.
It is not that spears became more valuable;
rather, the stones lost their purchasing power.
This phenomenon, known as inflation, was historically observed when the influx of gold and silver from the Americas into Europe eroded the value of existing currencies.
Inflation is not neutral:
those who first receive new money can purchase goods before prices adjust, gaining an unfair advantage.
Since governments always tried to control currency, they were always in a privileged position when we talk about inflation.

Finally, a good medium of exchange must function well across different transaction scales.
It should allow both large and small exchanges with practical amounts of the medium.
This was a particular challenge with gold:
being extremely valuable, even small transactions would require impractically tiny fragments of the metal.
To address this, societies often used silver alongside gold.
Silver, being less valuable by weight, was more convenient for everyday purchases, while gold was reserved for larger transactions and reserves.
A monetary system needs to accommodate the wide variety of economic interactions, from a daily loaf of bread to the purchase of land or ships.
The ability to transact smoothly at different scales is critical for supporting a vibrant, interconnected economy.

Gold and silver turn out to be excellent across the dimensions of space and time.
Both metals are chemically durable, resistant to corrosion, and universally recognizable across different cultures and jurisdictions.
However, they are not ideal in the scale dimension.
Fiat money, especially in its modern digital incarnations, performs very well across different scales:
it allows seamless transactions from the smallest to the largest amounts.
Yet, fiat currencies are highly dependent on centralized issuers.
They are often not portable across jurisdictions without significant barriers, and they are extremely vulnerable to inflationary policies worldwide.
Bitcoin, by contrast, excels across all three dimensions.
Its decentralized protocol is resistant to government interference, it is absolutely scarce—a topic we will explore in future lectures—and it is natively divisible, enabling the implementation of perfect money substitutes through mechanisms like payment channels, e-cash, and sidechains.
