# Lecture 1: What is Money? Why It Breaks

In this first lecture, our goal is to explore what money is, how it emerged, and how it evolved over time.
We are not aiming for a historically precise narrative, nor for an ultimate philosophical definition.
Rather, we are interested in understanding how money has been abstracted throughout history and how its problems, particularly in its fiat form, set the stage for the emergence of Bitcoin.
Our focus is practical:
by the end of this discussion, we want a clear sense of the problems Bitcoin was designed to address.

## Trading without Money is Hard

Imagine two individuals, Alice and Bob.
Alice is an electronics teacher, offering specialized lessons to those interested in learning about circuits, semiconductors, and signal processing.
Bob, on the other hand, is a farmer who grows carrots.
One day, Alice goes to Bob in a fair and offers an introductory lecture about the problems of money and how Bitcoin addresses them in return for a some carrots. At first glance, the exchange seems promising.
Carrots are nutritious food, and knowledge is a valuable asset.
Bob has been hearing about Bitcoin quite frequently lately and was interesting in understanding the technology to expand his business.
The next day, Bob comes to Alice's lecturing room and is delighted with an enlightening lecture.
He promptly hands Alice a basket of freshly harvested carrots and the economic transaction between them is done.

The economic transaction between Alice and Bob occurred because each party perceived the trade as a way to improve their own situation.
Bob valued gaining a better understanding of Bitcoin and its implications for his business more than he valued the basket of carrots he offered in exchange.
Alice, in turn, preferred obtaining fresh produce over giving a lecture.
As Mises explains in Human Action, "Acting man is eager to substitute a more satisfactory state of affairs for a less satisfactory.
His mind imagines conditions which suit him better, and his action aims at bringing about this desired state.
The incentive that impels a man to act is always some uneasiness."
In this example, both Alice and Bob acted to alleviate a sense of uneasiness, each envisioning a better condition achievable through voluntary exchange.
Their trade is a simple but powerful instance of how human cooperation and progress emerge naturally from individual efforts to improve personal circumstances.
However, for a voluntary exchange to occur, it is not enough for one party to desire the trade;
both parties must perceive an improvement in their situation.
If Bob had no interest in Bitcoin—or worse, if he viewed it as a shady technology or associated it with scams—he would have no incentive to accept Alice's offer.
In fact, given that Bitcoin remains a niche topic and is still misunderstood or mistrusted by many in her community, Alice would likely face great difficulty finding anyone willing to trade essential goods like food, clothing, or shelter for her lecture.

Barter relies on the unlikely alignment of immediate desires between two parties—a situation known as the double coincidence of wants.
Alice must find not just anyone, but someone who both needs electronics lectures and has something she personally desires at that moment.
The odds of matching her specialized knowledge to the immediate wants of others are slim.
The burden of matching these wants falls heavily on individuals, forcing them to spend significant time searching for suitable partners.

For Alice, this is particularly problematic.
Teaching is a service dependent on her time and attention.
Every hour spent seeking a trade partner is an hour not spent providing her lectures.
In a barter system, marketing her expertise competes directly with delivering her expertise.
The inefficiency is so profound that Alice might eventually abandon teaching altogether, turning instead to a more commonly needed activity, such as growing vegetables herself.
Society, in this way, does not benefit from specialization:
individuals are pressured to conform to more universally tradable goods and services rather than developing and offering unique talents.
We would not have the complex information-driven society if not for more powerful economic tool on our belts.

## Money as a Solution to the Double Coincidence of Wants

Bob, being a very attentive entrepreneur, quickly recognizes the difficulties in direct barter.
He is not personally interested in attending Alice's lecture, but he trusts her reputation and sees an opportunity.
Bob proposes an alternative arrangement:
he will give Alice a basket of carrots now, in exchange for a written contract—a promise from Alice stating that she will deliver an introductory Bitcoin lecture to whoever presents back the contract in the future.
This type of document is known as an IOU, short for "I Owe You."

Bob’s plan is clever.
He knows Charlie, the local baker, has been curious about Bitcoin for a while.
Bob hopes to use the IOU as a tradeable good:
offering it to Charlie in exchange for bread, a product Bob needs more urgently.
In doing so, Bob separates the problem of wanting bread from the problem of valuing Alice's lectures.
He doesn’t need to personally want Alice's service—he only needs confidence that someone else will.
The IOU functions as an intermediate good, making trade more flexible by broadening the range of possible transactions.
This clever solution effectively reduces the burden of the double coincidence of wants, allowing more specialization and easier trade.

Alice thinks this is a perfect arrangement for her.
After all, she's getting food right now and is happy to have new students, whoever they might be.
She promptly writes and signs the deed and hands it to Bob.
A week later, Bob meets Charlie, the local baker, and offers him the IOU in exchange for a few loaves of bread.
Charlie hesitates at first.
He does not know Alice personally and wonders whether the lecture will be useful to him or if Alice will even fulfill the promise.
He also worries about the authenticity of the document—after all, he knows Bob but cannot be absolutely certain there was no mistake or deceit.
Yet, after some thought, Charlie decides to accept the trade.
Bob has a good reputation, and Charlie sees value in securing a lecture on Bitcoin, even if there are risks.
They complete the trade:
Bob receives his bread, and Charlie holds the IOU promising a future lecture.

At this point, Bob's side of the transaction is fully settled:
he successfully traded Alice’s IOU for the bread he needed.
From his perspective, the trade chain—carrots for an IOU, then the IOU for bread—is complete and satisfactory.
We say it is fully settled.
Using an intermediate asset is more work, but without it the trade would have been impossible, since Charlie was not willing to accept carrots directly.
Intermediate goods like IOUs enable more flexible and complex trades by bridging gaps between what people currently have or will work to produce and what others want.
The initial provider of the good or service (Alice) and the final recipient (Charlie) do not need to interact simultaneously.
By separating immediate consumption from eventual fulfillment, intermediate goods make trade more flexible and scalable, enabling a broader and more dynamic market.

However, while Bob has concluded his exchange successfully, the situation for Charlie remains open-ended.
He now holds a promise of value, not the value itself.
For Charlie, the exchange is not fully settled.
He traded tangible bread—something that required his labor and resources—for a promise that may or may not be fulfilled.
If Alice honors the IOU, Charlie will have gained value;
if not, he will have incurred a loss.
The intermediate asset, while facilitating trade, carries inherent risks for the holder.
This is not unique to personal IOUs:
even commodity money like gold depends on the expectation that it will be accepted by others in future exchanges.
The same applies to fiat currencies and digital assets like Bitcoin.
The holder of an intermediate asset relies, to some extent, on the continued willingness of others to assign it any value.
Thus, while intermediate goods greatly improve market efficiency and flexibility, they also introduce a persistent underlying risk—the uncertainty of future acceptance.
As we will see, the intermediate asset provides other benefits that make them highly desirable in the real world, despite the risk.

While the introduction of an intermediate good greatly facilitates trade, it does not automatically create money.
For an asset to be considered money, it must become the most marketable intermediate good in the economy—the one asset that individuals universally accept in exchange, confident that they can later trade it for whatever they desire.
As Carl Menger explains in On the Origins of Money, money emerges not by decree but through a gradual process where individuals gravitate toward goods that possess superior qualities of marketability.
We will talk about these qualities next.

## Qualities of a good medium of exchange

To understand why some goods thrive as mediums of exchange while others fail, we must consider how well they perform across three critical dimensions:
space, time, and scale.
A good medium of exchange must facilitate trade across different locations (space), preserve value for future transactions (time), and allow practical exchanges of both small and large amounts (scale).

While IOUs improve barter by introducing an intermediate good, they still rely on the trustworthiness and future actions of specific individuals.
This dependence limits their usefulness, especially across broader communities where personal reputation cannot be easily verified.
A natural solution is to adopt "neutral" goods—objects that are not promises of future action but tangible, transferable items.
Neutral goods reduce the need for trust:
their acceptance does not depend on knowing or trusting the previous holder.
Furthermore, because their value is based on general expectations of future acceptance rather than personal obligation, they become more universally recognizable as mediums of exchange.
Throughout history, societies discovered that natural goods such as shells, stones, cattle, salt, and beads could serve this role.
Over time, precious metals like gold and silver emerged as especially favored intermediaries, particularly in ancient Greece.

The key advantage of a neutral good is that it does not depend on trust in any specific issuer.
It is not a debt, and its value in trade does not rest on someone else's future behavior.
Instead, its usefulness as an economic medium of exchange derives solely from the expectation that others will also accept it in future transactions.
Moreover, its suitability for economic exchanges does not hinge on any alternative practical use—such as being consumed as food or processed in industry.
This fundamental shift—from trusting individuals to trusting the generalized marketability of an object—marked a major milestone in the evolution of money.

Beyond spatial acceptance, a good candidate for money must also perform well over time.
It must allow individuals to accumulate value for future use without significant deterioration or loss.
Imagine someone who wishes to eventually buy a house but can only save small amounts at a time.
If the chosen medium of exchange perishes, rots, or erodes in value over time, saving becomes practically impossible.
Goods like fresh produce or cigarettes, although used as money in extreme circumstances, are poorly suited for long-term value storage.

Durability is crucial, but so is scarcity:
the medium must not be easily reproducible, otherwise saving is undermined by inflation.
To illustrate, consider an economy with 50 stones used as money and 10 spears available for trade.
If each spear costs 5 stones on average, and suddenly someone finds a mine producing 50 additional stones, the average price of spears would fall to 2 stones.
It is not that spears became more valuable;
rather, the stones lost their purchasing power.
This phenomenon, known as inflation, was historically observed when the influx of gold and silver from the Americas into Europe eroded the value of existing currencies.
Inflation is not neutral:
those who first receive new money can purchase goods before prices adjust, gaining an unfair advantage.
Since governments always tried to control currency, they were always in a privileged position when we talk about inflation.

Finally, a good medium of exchange must function well across different transaction scales.
It should allow both large and small exchanges with practical amounts of the medium.
This was a particular challenge with gold:
being extremely valuable, even small transactions would require impractically tiny fragments of the metal.
To address this, societies often used silver alongside gold.
Silver, being less valuable by weight, was more convenient for everyday purchases, while gold was reserved for larger transactions and reserves.
A monetary system needs to accommodate the wide variety of economic interactions, from a daily loaf of bread to the purchase of land or ships.
The ability to transact smoothly at different scales is critical for supporting a vibrant, interconnected economy.

Gold and silver turn out to be excellent across the dimensions of space and time.
Both metals are chemically durable, resistant to corrosion, and universally recognizable across different cultures and jurisdictions.
However, they are not ideal in the scale dimension.
Fiat money, especially in its modern digital incarnations, performs very well across different scales:
it allows seamless transactions from the smallest to the largest amounts.
Yet, fiat currencies are highly dependent on centralized issuers.
They are often not portable across jurisdictions without significant barriers, and they are extremely vulnerable to inflationary policies worldwide.
Bitcoin, by contrast, excels across all three dimensions.
Its decentralized protocol is resistant to government interference, it is absolutely scarce—a topic we will explore in future lectures—and it is natively divisible, enabling the implementation of perfect money substitutes through mechanisms like payment channels, e-cash, and sidechains.

## Banks as IOU Engines: A Layer Above Money

As trade expanded and precious metals like gold and silver became more widely used as money, practical difficulties began to emerge.
Large transactions were cumbersome, requiring heavy and often insecure physical transfers of coins or bullion.
Verifying the authenticity and weight of every coin in circulation was not only time-consuming but fraught with risk, especially in regions where coin debasement or clipping was common.
Merchants conducting business across cities or countries faced the added burden of dealing with a bewildering variety of local coinages with differing metallic contents and values.
To solve these problems, early banking institutions arose as a layer above money—initially offering secure storage for precious metals and later providing more efficient payment mechanisms through book-entry transfers and bank-issued notes​.

Banks made trade more efficient by formalizing the issuance of IOUs.
When an individual deposited gold into a bank, the bank issued a certificate representing the right to withdraw that amount of gold later.
These certificates—or banknotes—were easier to carry and transfer.
Over time, people began trading the banknotes directly, rather than redeeming them after each transaction.
What had started as a simple receipt for stored metal evolved into a widely accepted medium of exchange.
Even today, when we check our bank balance, we are not seeing the amount of money we own, but rather the amount the bank owes us.
The relationship remains one of creditor and debtor, where the banknote or digital balance is just a promise that the bank will honor redemptions when demanded.

To illustrate, let us return to Alice and Bob.
Suppose Alice deposits gold at the Dollarhaus bank and, in return, receives paper bills denominated in dollars, which represent claims on a specific amount of gold.
Later, Alice visits Bob at the market and offers him a few of these bills in exchange for a basket of carrots.
Bob accepts the payment and, curious about the backing of the bills, visits the issuing bank.
There, he presents the bills and receives gold from the bank's reserves.
Through this process, we see that no physical gold needed to change hands during Alice and Bob's transaction.
The bank-issued bills served as a convenient medium, while the underlying gold remained safely stored until redemption was requested.

This transformation—from using physical gold to trading paper notes redeemable for gold—marks the emergence of what Ludwig von Mises called "money substitutes."
These banknotes are not money themselves;
they are representations of money, issued against real reserves held by the bank.
Their usefulness lies in the fact that, at the time of their issuance, they could be redeemed on demand for actual money.
They served the same function as the underlying good in facilitating trade and settlement, but without the inconvenience of carrying and verifying the metal itself.
What makes this possible is the legally binding nature of the bank promise:
the note issuer enters into a contract to return the underlying asset to whoever presents it.
In the early stages of banking, this obligation was enforced primarily by reputation and the threat of failure.
Over time, it gained formal legal standing and, in many cases, became backed or regulated by the state.
In this sense, money substitutes operate as temporary stand-ins that streamline transactions while still being tightly linked to the monetary base.

In more complex economies, the system evolved further.
Suppose Bob prefers not to redeem the bills for gold directly.
Instead, he visits his own bank, Euroloft, and deposits the dollar-denominated bills he received from Alice.
Euroloft credits his account, and behind the scenes, the two banks later settle their obligations.
This might involve transferring gold or adjusting their mutual balances.
Over time, banks formed clearinghouses and cooperative agreements to streamline this process.
This allowed even currency conversion—for example, Bob could exchange dollars for euros if the banks involved held reserves in both currencies and trusted each other’s solvency.
In effect, the banking system built an interconnected layer atop the physical gold reserves.

Eventually, as banknotes and later digital entries became widely accepted, the need to redeem them for physical gold diminished.
If Bob knows that the bills he received are broadly accepted in the market, he may prefer to spend them again rather than reclaim the gold they represent.
The same bill might change hands dozens of times before anyone seeks redemption.
Redemption becomes necessary only when the neutrality of gold is essential—for instance, in international trade or when doubts arise about a bank’s solvency.
This widespread acceptance of paper, independent of frequent physical settlement, is what made banking systems so powerful—and, as we will see, also vulnerable to overreach and abuse.

## Communication Protocols as Money Substitutes

Let’s revisit Alice and Bob.
This time, Alice opens an account at her bank and receives a plastic card linked to it—a credit or debit card.
With this card, Alice can now initiate electronic payments by signing digital messages that instruct her bank to transfer a portion of her balance to Bob's account.
When Alice makes a payment, the bank doesn’t hand over physical cash or gold;
it updates its internal ledger.
It deducts the value from Alice’s account and credits the same amount to Bob’s.
Moments later, Bob’s bank notifies him that the payment has been received and his balance adjusted.
That's when he knows he can handle the basket of fresh carrots to Alice;
the exchange is finished.

In this system, the act of paying is entirely symbolic—a coordinated update to digital records.
These book-entry transfers mean that the money itself does not move.
Instead, what circulates are signed messages and account updates, and the integrity of this process depends entirely on the trust placed in the banks managing these ledgers.
The digital message—“transfer $20 from Alice to Bob”—serves the same function as the gold-backed banknote once did:
a medium of exchange that is accepted because the participants trust the system to settle accounts reliably.
As long as people are willing to accept these updates as settlement, they function as money substitutes.
But now, the medium is not metal or paper—it is a coordinated messaging protocol embedded in the architecture of banking.

This shift continues the long process of monetary abstraction.
We moved from a physical asset—gold—to a redeemable paper note that represented a claim on that asset.
The banknote was an IOU, and its issuance was disciplined by the need to maintain a credible promise of redemption.
It still bore essential characteristics of the physical medium it replaced:
when someone handed over a banknote, it was self-evident that they possessed the funds, and once the note changed hands, it could not be reused by the spender.
These were built-in assurances—ownership and finality—that came naturally with physical money, whether metal or paper.

As money becomes digital, however, these assurances are no longer inherent.
Digital representations of money can be copied or manipulated unless specific mechanisms are in place.
In this more abstract realm, we must explicitly design systems to prove that the sender has sufficient funds and to prevent double spending.
These are no longer physical properties but engineering challenges.

Banks solve these problems by serving as intermediaries.
They are no longer merely custodians of money;
they actively manage ledgers, authorize payments, and guarantee settlement between accounts.
Their role has expanded as money has become more abstract.
As Lawrence White explains in Better Money, banks have historically evolved from passive warehouses into financial engines that provide liquidity, manage payment systems, and extend credit.
Their ability to maintain accurate records and resolve disputes has made them indispensable—but also powerful.

And herein lies a problem.
In today's economy, we can hardly perform any transaction without the participation of a third party.
In technical terms, the bank is a single point of failure.
If it fails, misbehaves, or becomes compromised, the entire system falters.
This vulnerability is especially concerning because money is not just any good—it is the good that facilitates nearly all others.
Banks may be corrupted in various ways:
by negligent bankers, malicious insiders, software bugs, or coercion by state authorities.
The more abstract money becomes, the more central and fragile these intermediaries become.

It’s worth pausing to recognize how strange this arrangement really is.
Bob is accepting payment not in gold, not even in paper bills, but in the form of a message—words, essentially—delivered through a communication network.
And yet, that message is accepted as money because it comes with the bank’s authority and is reflected as a new number in Bob’s account balance.
This is not the first time we've accepted such a leap of abstraction:
earlier, people grew accustomed to using paper banknotes that merely represented underlying gold, and those notes came to be treated as if they were the gold itself.
Today, the same transformation has occurred again.
The messages transmitted between banks and the balances they report feel almost indistinguishable from real money.
We have already made peace with the idea that money can be abstract, symbolic, and entirely dependent on the integrity of a communication protocol.

## Concluding Remarks: Money as Abstraction and Choice

Money is not magic.
It is not handed down from authorities or discovered like a natural law.
It is something human beings invent—and reinvent—whenever the need to coordinate trade arises.
As we've seen throughout this lecture, money takes form in response to the practical problems of cooperation across time, space, and uncertainty.
Whether through IOUs, beads, gold coins, or digital messages, people will discover ways to create a medium of exchange that suits their needs.
That means anyone, anywhere, exposed to the challenge of economic exchange, can rediscover the logic of money.
This realization—that money is a tool, not a decree—should empower us to think critically about its design, its failures, and its possible futures.

This perspective helps explain why money appears so universally across human societies, even those that never interacted.
It is not a product of any particular culture or authority—it is a recurring solution to a recurring problem.
In that sense, money is part of human nature:
not because it is biologically programmed, but because it emerges wherever humans trade, plan, and specialize.
It is a natural consequence of living in a society where cooperation and temporal deferral of value are essential to progress.
Wherever people act under scarcity and seek to improve their condition though trading, money—or something like it—will arise.

Throughout this lecture, we’ve followed a simplified but conceptually rigorous account of how money evolved.
It’s important to recognize that money has taken many forms throughout history—shells, salt, cattle, silver, gold, paper, and now digital entries.
While our narrative hasn’t aimed at historical completeness, the key patterns and transitions we’ve explored are real and foundational.
What matters is not the timeline but the logic:
how humans created increasingly abstract ways to facilitate economic cooperation.

Money is not a single object, but a set of functions.
Economists often describe these as medium of exchange, store of value, and unit of account.
Every monetary form we've discussed—from gold coins to credit card authorizations—has sought to fulfill these roles.
Each does so imperfectly, and each trade-off reflects technological constraints, political realities, and evolving economic demands.
In this sense, money is a technology:
an invention designed to solve the problem of coordinating human exchange over time and space.

The more abstract money becomes, the more convenient it is to use—and the more sophisticated the economic systems it enables.
Digital balances allow for instant payments across the globe, sophisticated financial contracts, and coordination at unprecedented scale.
Because money touches nearly every transaction, its form sets a ceiling on what economies can do.
The abstraction of money has unlocked modern economic complexity, but at a cost.

As we’ve seen, abstraction brings fragility.
In today’s world, physical cash is disappearing, and most payments depend on centralized intermediaries.
Governments are increasingly pushing for centralized digital currencies, which would amplify problems:
surveillance, censorship, loss of privacy, and vulnerability to policy failure.
The more abstract and centralized the monetary layer becomes, the greater the danger posed by its failure or abuse.

Bitcoin represents a radically new path.
It is the first system that enables digital money without a trusted central intermediary.
For the first time in history, it offers a decentralized, programmable medium of exchange that enforces ownership and prevents double spending purely through code and consensus.
We will spend the rest of this course exploring how Bitcoin works and how it addresses the problems we’ve outlined.
But we will also remain grounded:
Bitcoin is a superior implementation of money in many respects, but whether it becomes widely used as money is not up to any authority.
That decision rests, as it always has, with individuals making voluntary choices.
Bitcoin is not merely a new asset—it is a technological implementation of money, grounded in formal rules, economic incentives, and decentralized enforcement.
Decentralization of money is also the decentralization of the decision of what to use as money.

It's up to you to decide if Bitcoin is money.
And I hope this course will help you do so.
