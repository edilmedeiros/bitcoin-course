# Lecture 2: Bitcoin as a Protocol for Ownership Transfer

In the previous lecture, we explored how money emerges to solve coordination problems in trade.
We saw that money is not a static thing, but a technological tool:
a set of functions that evolves to meet the demands of space, time, and scale in economic exchange.
We also explored how money has become increasingly abstractâ€”eventually transforming into communication protocols managed by trusted intermediaries.
In this lecture, we begin our study of Bitcoin by taking a bird's-eye view of its architecture.
We will introduce its most important components without diving into full technical detail yet.

Our goal is to understand what Bitcoin is as a system, and what kinds of problems it is designed to solve.
We will continue using the stories of Alice and Bob to illustrate how Bitcoin reimagines the concept of digital money.

## Transactions as Messages of Ownership Change

[todo: describe bitcoin transactions as signed messages that transfer value; bring Alice and Bob back as an example; stress that ownership is defined through the ability to authorize spending]

## Programming Transfers: Bitcoin Script and the Semantics of Inputs and Outputs

[todo: explain outputs as encumbered coins; inputs as satisfying conditions to spend; introduce the term UTXO; maybe postpone implementation details to later lectures]

## The Double Spending Problem

[todo: introduce the timing problem and the possibility of broadcasting conflicting transactions; highlight that this problem only appears when money becomes digital and decentralized]

[todo: explain that the peer-to-peer network and blockchain structure solve this by introducing a notion of shared history that can be verified and extended]

## Anchoring Trust with Proof-of-Work

[todo: explain how proof-of-work connects the communication layer to physical constraints, making it costly to rewrite history; frame miners as economic agents incentivized to extend the chain honestly]

[todo: show how this mechanism removes the need for a central timestamping authority]

## Concluding Overview

[todo: recap the major components of Bitcoin introduced here and preview how the following lectures will explore each one in detail]
